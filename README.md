# IEM-diffusion

Diffusion analysis via Gromacs and Travis, simulations run with OpenMM using
Gromacs files.

Polymer chains are constrained during NpT equilibration, under the assumption
that they have already been equiibrated with a procedure like Hofmann's 21-step
equilibration (explained here: DOI:10.1007/s00214-013-1334-z)
